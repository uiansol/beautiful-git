### How to use
1. Save git-completion.bash file in your home directory with the rename it to .git-completion.bash
2. Save git-prompt.sh file in your home directory with the rename it to .git-prompt.sh
3. Copy the content from bashrc and paste it at the bottom of .bashrc in your home (create .bashrc if they are not present).

On Mac place it on .bash_profile rather than .bashrc.
